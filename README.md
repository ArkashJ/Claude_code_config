# Claude Code Config

Personal `~/.claude` configuration for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — versioned so the same
setup is reproducible across machines in under two minutes.

Everything generated or machine-specific (transcripts, caches, credentials, downloaded plugin code)
is git-ignored. Only hand-authored config is committed.

### What is never committed

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `projects/` | Full conversation transcripts — may contain client data (1.4 GB) |
| `context-mode/` | ctx knowledge-base SQLite DB (1.2 GB) |
| `plugins/cache,data,marketplaces/` | Downloaded plugin code — reinstall from manifest |
| `security/` | Security-related caches (266 MB) |
| `file-history/` | Local edit history (134 MB) |
| `history.jsonl` | CLI history — may contain secrets passed on the command line |
| `settings.local.json` | Machine-specific overrides |
| `.credentials.json` | Credentials — stored in macOS Keychain |
| `*-cache.json`, `*.bak` | Ephemeral state |

## New machine setup

Claude Code creates `~/.claude` on first run. Clone on top of it:

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code (https://claude.ai/code) — creates ~/.claude
# 2. Then, in a terminal:
cd ~/.claude
./sync.sh setup https://github.com/ArkashJ/Claude_code_config.git
```

`sync.sh setup` runs: `git init → remote add → fetch → reset --hard origin/main → set upstream`.
It only overwrites tracked config files; your local transcripts and caches are untouched.

### Restore plugins after setup

The committed JSON manifests list every plugin that was installed:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json   # which marketplaces to add
cat ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json     # which plugins to install
```

Re-add them inside Claude Code via `/plugin add <marketplace>` and `/plugin install <name>`.

---

## Day-to-day sync

```bash
cd ~/.claude
./sync.sh status              # show pending tracked changes
./sync.sh push "message"      # commit all tracked changes and push (message optional)
./sync.sh pull                # rebase local config on top of remote
./sync.sh setup <git-url>     # first-time setup on a new machine (see above)
```

Flow across two machines:

```
Machine A                          GitHub                        Machine B
   │                                  │                               │
   ├─ edit CLAUDE.md ────────────────►│                               │
   ├─ ./sync.sh push ────────────────►│                               │
   │                                  │◄── ./sync.sh pull ────────────┤
   │                                  │                               ├─ changes applied
```

## Adding a file or directory to version control

The `.gitignore` uses a **whitelist** pattern (`/*` ignores everything; `!path` re-includes).
A new top-level file is ignored by default until explicitly allowed:

```bash
# 1. Add a re-include line to .gitignore
echo '!/my-new-file.md' >> ~/.claude/.gitignore

# 2. Or for a new directory and all its contents
echo '!/my-dir/' >> ~/.claude/.gitignore

# 3. Commit the gitignore change + the new file together
./sync.sh push "track my-new-file"
```

Installed via `npx skills add <package>` and stored in `skills/`.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ast-grep` | Structural code search using AST patterns |
| `build-a-chatbot` | Chatbot / AI assistant wiring guide |
| `client-value-maximizer` | High-impact codebase improvement audit |
| `docx` / `pdf` / `xlsx` | Document creation and manipulation |
| `playwright-cli` | Browser automation and E2E testing |
| `playwright-doc-generator` | Screenshot-driven client-facing docs |
| `frontend-design` | Production-grade UI component generation |
| `network-graph-modal` | Force-directed relationship graph modal |
| `vercel-react-best-practices` | React / Next.js performance patterns |
| `vercel-composition-patterns` | React composition and component API design |
| `remotion-best-practices` | Video creation in React with Remotion |
| `presentation_maker` | Formatted presentation generation |
| `find-skills` | Skill discovery from the skills.sh ecosystem |

Browse all installed skills in `skills/`.

## Hooks

Hooks run automatically on Claude Code events (configured in `settings.json`):

| Hook | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `context-mode-cache-heal.mjs` | PreToolUse | Ensures context-mode cache is healthy before tool calls |

---

## RTK (Rust Token Killer)

All shell commands are transparently rewritten through `rtk` (a token-optimizing proxy)
via a hook in `settings.json`. See `RTK.md` for usage and `rtk gain` for savings analytics.
